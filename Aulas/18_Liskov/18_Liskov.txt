=== Liskov Substitution Principle ===

* Let's design a Rectangle class. What would be the methods that it contain?

* Can you design a test for this class?

void test00() {
  Rectangle rect(2.0, 3.0);
  assert(rect.getWidth() == 2.0);
  assert(rect.getHeight() == 3.0);
  assert(rect.getArea() == 6.0);
  rect.setWidth(4.0);
  assert(rect.getWidth() == 4.0);
  assert(rect.getHeight() == 3.0);
  assert(rect.getArea() == 12.0);
  rect.setHeight(5.0);
  assert(rect.getWidth() == 4.0);
  assert(rect.getHeight() == 5.0);
  assert(rect.getArea() == 20.0);
}

* Can you design the class itself?

#include "assert.h"
class Rectangle {
  public:
    Rectangle(double width, double height) {
      setWidth(width);
      setHeight(height);
    }
    double getWidth() const {
      return _width;
    }
    double getHeight() const {
      return _height;
    }
    virtual void setWidth(double width) {
      assert(width >= 0.0 && "Width cannot be negative");
      _width = width;
    }
    virtual void setHeight(double height) {
      assert(height >= 0.0 && "Height cannot be negative");
      _height = height;
    }
    double getArea() const {
      return _width * _height;
    }
  private:
    double _width;
    double _height;
};

* Now, imagine that we want to design a class Square. Are squares also
  rectangles?

* Which properties could we inherit from Rectangle?
- setWidth and setHeight must change, for we cannot have Squares with
  sides of different lengths.

* To allow overriding these properties, must we change them in Rectangle?
- They must be virtual methods.
- Rectangle should have a virtual destructor.

* Can you design a test for Square?

void test01("Testing the square class:") {
  Square sq(3.0);
  assert(sq.getWidth() == 3.0);
  assert(sq.getHeight() == 3.0);
  assert(sq.getArea() == 9.0);
  sq.setWidth(4.0);
  assert(sq.getWidth() == 4.0);
  assert(sq.getHeight() == 4.0);
  assert(sq.getArea() == 16.0);
  sq.setHeight(5.0);
  assert(sq.getWidth() == 5.0);
  assert(sq.getHeight() == 5.0);
  assert(sq.getArea() == 25.0);
}

* And can you design a class Square that passes this test?

class Square: public Rectangle {
  public:
    Square(double side): Rectangle(side, side) {
    }
    void setWidth(double side) {
      assert(side >= 0.0 && "Width cannot be negative");
      Rectangle::setWidth(side);
      Rectangle::setHeight(side);
    }
    void setHeight(double side) {
      assert(side >= 0.0 && "Height cannot be negative");
      Rectangle::setWidth(side);
      Rectangle::setHeight(side);
    }
};

* Write a test to a method "double sumAreas(std::vector<Rectangle*>& vec)",
  which receives a vector of Rectangles, and returns the sum of areas:

void test02() {
  Rectangle *r0 = new Rectangle(2.0, 3.0);
  Rectangle *r1 = new Square(5.0);
  std::vector<Rectangle*> vec;
  vec.push_back(r0);
  vec.push_back(r1);
  assert(sumAreas(vec) == 31.0);
  delete r0;
  delete r1;
}

* Now, write the method sumAreas:

double sumAreas(std::vector<Rectangle*>& vec) {
  double sum = 0.0;
  for (Rectangle* r: vec) {
    sum += r->getArea();
  } 
  return sum;
}

* Write a test to a function
  "void incAreas(std::vector<Rectangle*>& vec, const double factor)",
  which increments the area of every rectangle by factor.

void test03() {
  Rectangle *r0 = new Rectangle(2.0, 3.0);
  Rectangle *r1 = new Square(5.0);
  std::vector<Rectangle*> vec;
  vec.push_back(r0);
  vec.push_back(r1);
  assert(sumAreas(vec) == 31.0);
  incAreas(vec, 1.1);
  assert(sumAreas(vec) == 1.1 * 31.0);
  delete r0;
  delete r1;
}

* Implement a function incAreas that passes this test:

void incAreas(std::vector<Rectangle*>& vec, const double factor) {
  for (Rectangle* r: vec) {
    r->setHeight(r->getHeight() * factor);
  }
}

* What went wrong with this test?

* Is a Square really a Rectangle?

* What a mutable Square. Is it really a mutable Rectangle?

* Does a mutable Square preserve all the pre- and post-conditions of a mutable
  Rectangle?

* What are the pre--conditions of setWidth?
- assert(width >= 0.0 && "Width cannot be negative");

* Are these pre-conditions preserved in Square?
- Yes.

* What are the post-conditions of mutable Rectangle?

virtual void setWidth(double width) {
  assert(width >= 0.0 && "Width cannot be negative");
  double currentHeight = getHeight();
  _width = width;
  assert(currentHeight == getHeight() && "Error: height has changed!");
}

* Is this post-condition preserved by mutable Square?
- not really.

* Which guidelines should we observe when using inheritance?
- The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
  Let P(x) be a property of object x of type T. Then P(y) must be true for
  any object y of type S, if S is a subtype of T.

* How can we ensure LSP?
1 - Preconditions cannot be strengthened in a subtype.
2 - Postconditions cannot be weakened in a subtype.
3 - Invariants of the supertype must be preserved in a subtype.

* What is the rule that our implementation of Square is breaking?
- We are weakening the post-conditions of Rectangle.

* How to solve this issue?

=== LSP: Dealing with the Problem ===

* Would it be a problem if Rectangles and Squares were immutable?

* Can you implement a test for an immutable version of Rectangle?

void test00() {
  Rectangle rect0(2.0, 3.0);
  assert(rect0.getWidth() == 2.0);
  assert(rect0.getHeight() == 3.0);
  assert(rect0.getArea() == 6.0);
}

* And how would be the implementation of this immutable Rectangle?

class Rectangle {
  public:
    Rectangle(double width, double height): _width(width), _height(height) {}
    double getWidth() const {
      return _width;
    }
    double getHeight() const {
      return _height;
    }
    double getArea() const {
      return _width * _height;
    }
  private:
    const double _width;
    const double _height;
};

* Can you think on a test for an immutable implementation of Square?

void test01() {
  Square sq0(3.0);
  assert(sq0.getWidth() == 3.0);
  assert(sq0.getHeight() == 3.0);
  assert(sq0.getArea() == 9.0);
}

* How would then be the implementation of Square?

class Square: public Rectangle {
  public:
    Square(double side): Rectangle(side, side) {}
};

* Would we have to change the test of sumAreas()? The test is given below:

TEST_CASE("Testing function sumAreas:") {
  Rectangle *r0 = new Rectangle(2.0, 3.0);
  Rectangle *r1 = new Square(5.0);
  std::vector<Rectangle*> vec;
  vec.push_back(r0);
  vec.push_back(r1);
  CHECK(sumAreas(vec) == 31.0);
  delete r0;
  delete r1;
}

* And the implementation of sumAreas, would we have to change it?
// Not really:
double sumAreas(std::vector<Rectangle*>& vec) {
  double sum = 0.0;
  for (Rectangle* r: vec) {
    sum += r->getArea();
  }
  return sum;
}

* What about function incAreas, would we have to change it?
- Yes, because we no longer have a way to change the height or width of
  Rectangles or Squares.

* Can you think about a new signature for this function?

void incAreas(
    std::vector<Rectangle*>& src,
    std::vector<Rectangle*>& dst,
    const double factor
)

* Can you implement a test for this new signature?

TEST_CASE("Testing the function that manipulate areas:") {
  Rectangle *r0 = new Rectangle(2.0, 3.0);
  Rectangle *r1 = new Square(5.0);
  std::vector<Rectangle*> vec;
  vec.push_back(r0);
  vec.push_back(r1);
  std::vector<Rectangle*> dst;
  SUBCASE("sumAreas:") {
    CHECK(sumAreas(vec) == 31.0);
  }
  SUBCASE("incAreas:") {
    incAreas(vec, dst, 1.1);
    CHECK(sumAreas(dst) == 1.1 * 31.0);
  }
  delete r0;
  delete r1;
}

* And can you implement a version of incAreas that passes this test?

void incAreas(
    std::vector<Rectangle*>& src,
    std::vector<Rectangle*>& dst,
    const double factor
) {
  dst.clear();
  for (Rectangle* r: src) {
    dst.push_back(new Rectangle(r->getWidth(), r->getHeight() * 1.1));
  }
}

* Does this program have a memory leak?
- Yes, absolutely!

* How to avoid it?

void test04() {
  Rectangle *r0 = new Rectangle(2.0, 3.0);
  Rectangle *r1 = new Square(5.0);
  std::vector<Rectangle*> vec;
  vec.push_back(r0);
  vec.push_back(r1);
  std::vector<Rectangle*> dst;
  assert(sumAreas(vec) == 31.0);
  incAreas(vec, dst, 1.1);
  assert(sumAreas(dst) == 1.1 * 31.0);
  for (Rectangle* r: dst) {
    delete r;
  }
  delete r0;
  delete r1;
}

* Can you think about other solutions to this problem of Rectangles and
  Squares?
- We could change the modeling. Instead of having a Square to extend the
  Rectangle, we could have the Rectangle extending the Square.

* Would this solution above work well? Can you try it?

=== Inheritance: when to use it? ===

* Ideally, we should avoid inheritance if the subclass can change state of
  the superclass. Why?

* Is it always safe to extend immutable data?
- Well, not really.

* Can you give an example of something that can go wrong?

* Consider the class below. What does it represent?
class Integer {
  public:
    Integer(unsigned long i, bool positive=true): _i(i), _positive(positive) {}
    virtual Integer inv() const {
      return Integer(_i, !_positive);
    }
    bool operator == (const Integer& i) const {
      return i._i == _i && i._positive == _positive;
    }
    std::string toString () const {
      return (_positive ? "+" : "-") + std::to_string(_i);
    }
  private:
    const unsigned long _i;
    const bool _positive;
};

* Can you extend it to have a class of natural numbers?

class Natural: public Integer {
  public:
    Natural(unsigned long i): Integer(i) {}
    Integer* inv() const {
      std::cout << "Natural numbers don't have inverses.\n";
      exit(1);
    }
};

* What is the problem with this model?

* Can you write a function to negate a set of Integer instances? Start with the
  test:

void test01() {
  const int TEST_SIZE = 10;
  std::vector<Integer*> ints;  
  for (int i = 0; i < TEST_SIZE; i++) {
    ints.push_back(new Natural(i));
  }
  std::vector<Integer*> negs;
  neg(ints, negs);
  for (int i = 0; i < TEST_SIZE; i++) {
    assert(*ints[i]->inv() == *negs[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < TEST_SIZE; i++) {
    delete ints[i];
    delete negs[i];
  }
}

* Can you now implement the neg function?

void neg(std::vector<Integer*>& src, std::vector<Integer*>& dst) {
  dst.clear();
  for (Integer* i: src) {
    dst.push_back(i->inv());
  }
}

* What if we tried to negate Naturals, what would happen? What would be the
  result of the test below?

void test01() {
  const int TEST_SIZE = 10;
  std::vector<Integer*> ints;
  for (int i = 0; i < TEST_SIZE; i++) {
    ints.push_back(new Natural(i));
  }
  std::vector<Integer*> negs;
  neg(ints, negs);
  for (int i = 0; i < TEST_SIZE; i++) {
    assert(*ints[i]->inv() == *negs[i]);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < TEST_SIZE; i++) {
    delete ints[i];
    delete negs[i];
  }
}

* Is Natural a good extension of Integer?

* What is the problem with this modeling? What property below is it breaking?

1 - Preconditions cannot be strengthened in a subtype.
2 - Postconditions cannot be weakened in a subtype.
3 - Invariants of the supertype must be preserved in a subtype.

- We are removing a valid property of Integer, e.g., neg. Code that expects
  Integers should be able to apply neg on them. We are breaking the contract
  of this code, because we are not meeting its pre-conditions.

* So, what's the pre-condition expected by the neg function?
- That its inputs be "negatable".

* Is this pre-condition met by Naturals?

* Would we have this problem if we extended only abstract classes?
- We cannot change the behavior of objects of an abstract class, because an abstract
  class cannot be instantiated.
